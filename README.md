# Yapped Rune Bear SE

This is optimized version of Yapped Rune Bear which is much faster in exporting and importing CSV files as import / export was **incredibly** poorly coded so it just sucks (6x - 34x speedup).

Although this executable requires to have .NET 7.0 runtime to be installed and you can get it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) and download ".NET Desktop Runtime 7.\*.\*" as it is not available by default on old versions of Windows such as 7 or 8.1 or even 10 (Microsoft hasn't really cared much about providing updated .net runtimes by default and you are required to install them manually)

## Requirements
.NET 7.0 Desktop Runtime
